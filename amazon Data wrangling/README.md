This Jupyter Notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of pet product reviews. The data consists of reviews of pet products such as toys, food, and leashes, including the reviewer's ID, the product ASIN, the reviewer's name, the review text, and the overall rating.

## The following methods and steps were used in the analysis:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing: The data was loaded into the notebook, and any missing or irrelevant data was removed.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The distribution of the overall ratings and the most common words used in the reviews were visualized using histograms and word clouds, respectively.
- Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment of each review was determined using the TextBlob library, which uses a pre-trained sentiment model. The overall sentiment for each product was visualized using bar plots.
- Further Analysis: Further analysis was performed to see the correlation between helpfulness and overall rating, and to see if the sentiment of a review affects its helpfulness.
- Conclusion: Based on the results of the analysis, a conclusion was drawn regarding the most helpful and highly rated pet products.
