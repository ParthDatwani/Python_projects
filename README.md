# Python projects

I created this Git repo for personal use to store my Python projects on Big Data. Centralizes my code, makes project management easier and allows me to access my work from anywhere. Ideal for organizing and streamlining my big data journey.

# Data

The Amazon Product Review dataset contains reviews, product information, and links related to Amazon products. It covers a span of 18 years, from May 1996 to July 2014, and contains a total of 142.8 million reviews. The dataset includes the following details:

- Product reviews (including ratings, text, and helpfulness votes)
- Product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features)
- Links between products (also viewed/also bought graphs)
- For those using the dataset for a class project or similar purpose, smaller subsets of the data are available for experimentation. However, if larger files are needed, one will need to contact the owner of the dataset for access.
